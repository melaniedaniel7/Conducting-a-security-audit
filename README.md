# Conducting-a-security-audit

"Security audits help ensure that security checks are made, to monitor for threats, risks, or vulnerabilities that can affect an organization’s business continuity and critical assets". 

In this portfolio project provided by Google through Coursera I considered risks to Botium Toys’ customers, employees, and/or assets, based on controls and compliance best practices that are or are not currently implemented.

Please refer to the Controls and compliance checklist file if you would like an overview of the various controls and compliance criteria I assessed.
