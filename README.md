# Conducting-a-security-audit

"Security audits help ensure that security checks are made, to monitor for threats, risks, or vulnerabilities that can affect an organization’s business continuity and critical assets". 

In this portfolio project provided by Google through Corsera I considered risks to Botium Toys’ customers, employees, and/or assets, based on controls and compliance best practices that are or are not currently implemented.

Please refer to the Controls and compliance checklist file if you would like an overview of the various controls and compliance criteria I assessed. This assessment and summary was done using a control and compliance document of various categories and criteria provided to me by Google through the Corseara learning platform.

After conducting an analysis of the controls and compliance criteria currently in place and currently not in place I found that there were two controls that were not implemented properly, there were seven controls that were not implemented at all, and nine compliances that were not implemented.

I therefore reccomend that Botium Toys' update the password polices and manual monitoring for legacy systems that they currently have in place for their controls. Although password policies are in place they do not adhere to having at least eight
characters, a combination of letters and at least one number; special characters. This could allow a threat
actor to more easily access secure data/other assets via employee work equipment/the internal network. For the manual monitoring for legacy systems the risk assessment indicates that there is no regular schedule in place for these tasks and intervention methods are unclear, which could place these systems at risk of a breach.

Other recommendation that I would make regarding controls for Botium Toys' is to implement: 
- Least Privilege: Reduce risk and overall impact of malicious insider or compromised accounts
- Disaster Recovery Plans: Provide business continuity
- Separation of Duties: Reduce risk and overall impact of malicious insider or compromised accounts
- Intrusion Detection System (IDS): To detect and prevent anomalous traffic that matches a signature or rule
- Backups: Restore/recover from an event
- Encryption: Provide confidentiality to sensitive information
- Password Management System: Reduce password fatigue

There were a lot of compliances that Botium Toys' did not have in place, including:
- Unauthorized users have access to customers’ credit card information (PCI DSS).
- Credit card information is not stored, accepted, processed, and transmitted securely (PCI DSS).
- Data encryption procedures for credit card transaction touchpoints is not implemented (PCI DSS).
- secure password management policies are not adopted (PCI DSS).
- E.U. customers’ data is not kept private/secured (GDPR).
- Botium Toys' cannot ensure that data is properly classified and inventoried (GDPR).
- User access policies are not established (SOC).
- Sensitive data (PII/SPII) is not confidential/private (SOC).
- Data is not only available to authorized individuals (SOC).

Therefore, to address compliance gaps, Botium Toys must implement controls such as Least Privilege, separation of duties, and encryption. Additionally, the company should ensure proper classification of its assets to identify further controls that may be necessary to enhance its security posture and better safeguard sensitive information.
